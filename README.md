# Herm

![Herm startup splash screen](./assets/readme-splash.png)

Chat stays on the left. The sidebar and tabs expose model/profile state,
sessions, context, agents, analytics, skills, cron, toolsets, config, env,
memory, and kanban without leaving the terminal.

> **herm** /hɜːm/ _noun_ : a sculptured head of Hermes on a square stone
> pillar, used in ancient Greece as a boundary marker at crossroads.

## Why Herm

Herm gives Hermes Agent an operator-focused TUI instead of scattering work
across shell commands, config files, and browser windows.

- **Stay in the terminal** while chatting with Hermes Agent, resuming sessions,
  and inspecting context.
- **Operate your Hermes home** through dashboard tabs for profiles, skills,
  cron jobs, toolsets, config, env, and memory.
- **Run agentic work through kanban** with boards, task detail views,
  diagnostics, and dispatch controls.
- **Make the shell yours** with rebindable keys, a command palette, slash
  commands, theme picker, and profile switching.

Herm is built with [OpenTUI](https://github.com/anomalyco/opentui) and
[Bun](https://bun.sh/). It is a client for the Hermes Agent gateway, not a
separate agent runtime.

## Quickstart

Herm requires:

- a working [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) install
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) or a Node package runner
- a Hermes home at `~/.hermes`, or `HERMES_HOME` pointing somewhere else

Try Herm without installing:

```bash
bunx herm-tui
```

Install it globally:

```bash
bun add -g herm-tui        # stable
npm i -g herm-tui          # also fine
bun add -g herm-tui@next   # bleeding edge, every dev push
```

Run it:

```bash
herm       # fresh session
herm -c    # resume last session
```

Or run from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/liftaris/herm.git
cd herm
bun install
bun run src/index.tsx
```

See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for rarely-needed overrides.

## What you can do

### Chat with Hermes Agent

- Stream responses with markdown rendering, LaTeX-to-unicode conversion, inline
  images through `chafa`, diff chips, and expandable tool calls.
- Add file and diff context with `@` references.
- Use slash commands for session control, model switching, skins, keybindings,
  and app actions.
- Resume, title, and manage sessions without dropping back to another command.

### Operate your Hermes home

- Switch Hermes profiles from inside the TUI.
- Inspect and manage operational surfaces: sessions, context, agents,
  analytics, skills, cron, toolsets, config, env, and memory.

### Run kanban work

- Use the kanban tab as an agent work surface rather than a detached project
  board.
- Open board and task detail views, inspect diagnostics, and dispatch work from
  the same shell you use for chat.

### Share and install eikons

- Open Eikon → Marketplace, or run `/marketplace`, to browse shared catalog
  entries.
- Preview the selected eikon, install without activating, then use it when
  ready.
- Use `eikon.liftaris.dev` as a discovery gallery only; it previews catalog
  entries and gives copyable Herm install instructions.
- Submit local non-bundled eikons from Studio with `u`; Herm shows the exact
  preflight bundle before submission and blocks published marketplace installs
  from duplicate submission.

Herm owns native Marketplace behavior. The eikon repo owns the registry,
browser mirror, shared catalog/player exports, install resolver, and publish
preflight. Herm imports public eikon package exports rather than browser mirror
internals or unexported source paths.

### Customize the shell

- Press `Ctrl+K` for the command palette.
- Type `/` for the slash popover.
- Type `/theme` to browse built-in themes.
- Type `/keys` to view and rebind keybindings, including OpenCode-compatible
  bindings.
- Use `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` to move between top-level tabs. Arrow keys navigate
  within a tab.

If text is hard to read in tmux or a dark terminal, try a light theme such as
`daylight`, `mercury`, or `github`. If tmux is the issue,
`set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"` in `~/.tmux.conf` often fixes color
handling.

## Status and compatibility

Herm does not guarantee backward compatibility with older versions of Hermes.
Hermes is constantly updating, and things are bound to break. Regular Hermes
parity sweeps and updates are done to keep Herm current.

Herm is the dashboard TUI for Hermes Agent. It does not replace Hermes Agent,
implement model providers itself, or own Hermes runtime behavior.

## Development

```bash
bun run dev
bun run typecheck
bun test
```
